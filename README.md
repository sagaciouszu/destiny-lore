**Version:** 0.2.1 | **Status:** Development

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** This repository is under heavy development while the knowledge base is being constructed. Expect frequent changes, incomplete data, and shifting structure. The author's prowess is not to be trusted with anything important. Use at your own risk.

A shared, indexed repository of Destiny 2 lore ingested from the Ishtar Collective.
Any agent (Drifter persona, lore research, etc.) may reference these files at will.

## Structure

- `index.md` - Master book list with ingestion status (pending/done/partial).
- `books/<slug>.md` - Full text of each ingested book, entries as `##` sections.
- `transcripts/<slug>.md` - Transcripts (quest dialogue) as ingested.
- `tests/` - Validation and verification scripts (25 scripts).
- `drifter-master-audit.sh` - Unified audit runner (stays at root).

## How to use

1. Check `index.md` for a book's status and slug.
2. Read `books/<slug>.md` for the full lore text.
3. Entries within a book are separated by `## Entry Title` headers.

## Ingestion rules

- Only lore body text is kept - site navigation, headers, footers, category lists, timeline widgets, and "Discuss this transcript" links are stripped.
- If an entry cannot be fetched, the book is marked `partial` with a note; nothing is invented.
- Capitalization matters: "Guardian" (capitalized) generally refers to the player character.
